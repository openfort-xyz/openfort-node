# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## How to create a changeset

Run `pnpm changeset` to create a new changeset. This will guide you through the process of describing your changes and selecting the appropriate version bump.

## Workflow

1. Make your changes
2. Run `pnpm changeset` to describe your changes
